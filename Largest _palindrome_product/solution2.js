 * @Problem : A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
   Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
 * @function isPalindrome - take a number and check if it is palindrome or not.
 * @return {number} max - the largest palindrome product made using 3 digit numbers.
 * 
 * Solution explanation :
 *   The palindrome can be written as:
 *   abccba
 *   Which then simpifies to:
 *   100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100c + 10b + a
 *   And then:
 *   100001a + 10010b + 1100c
 *   Factoring out 11, you get:
 *   11(9091a + 910b + 100c)
 *   So the palindrome must be divisible by 11.  Seeing as 11 is prime, at least one of the numbers must be divisible by 11.
